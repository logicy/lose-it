flags in matrix
n:1,2,3,4... = occupied by n-th player; not-clickable
[<=0| 0,-1,..] = empty
0 = empty; clickable
-1 = empty; not-clickable [may be game over| need some condition to be clickable]

OOP

board: size-m, size-n, cell
board.cell: i,j
game: matrix, board-size, noOfPlayers, win-algo(), winner
player: name, record, move(cell)
//move: coordinates, playerKey
bot: name, smartness, move(lastMove,game.matrix)
matrix: "all i,j values of cells on board"
player.record: wins, loss, ties, "in which levels"


levels: [{sequence, levelConfig},...]
levelConfig: board, botEnabled, toughness
-------


rule:
whenever game is over by win: empty cells will become -1

more levels:
incremental = board will be 4x4 but clickable area 'd be 3x3 [0,1,2]x[0,1,2]; when its filled (and/or game is tie) rest area [0,1,2,3]<->[3] (light dimmed) 'd become clickable; and game will proceed
